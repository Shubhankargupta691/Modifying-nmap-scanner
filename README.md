# Modifying-nmap-scanner

Nmap (Network Mapper) is a free and open-source tool used for network exploration, management, and security auditing. It is a very powerful scanner that can be used to discover hosts and services on a computer network, thus creating a "map" of the network. Nmap can be used to identify hosts and services on a network, as well as their operating systems, and detect open ports and vulnerabilities.
